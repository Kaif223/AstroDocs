# Main Documentation Test

This is a test file in the main `docs/` folder to verify auto-discovery.

## Expected Location

This file should appear in the **"All Documentation"** section of the navigation.

## Test Details

- **File**: `main-docs-test.mdx`
- **Location**: `src/content/docs/` (main folder)
- **Should appear in**: "All Documentation" section

If you can see this page in the "All Documentation" section, then auto-discovery for the main docs folder is working! ✅

## Troubleshooting Your NewGuide

If this test file appears but your `NewGuide.mdx` doesn't, it might be due to:
- File name casing issues
- Content formatting problems
- Cache issues

*Test file - can be deleted once functionality is confirmed.*
